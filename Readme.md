## Counting Words
This project is composed by the files: `main.py` and `count_words.py`.  
The `main.py` file calls the function `count_words` and use as parameter the `file_name`.  
Three text files are in the repository, however be aware that for the program run properly the files have to be in the work folder. But don't worry, if they aren't the program will show a error message with the correct folder to you move them.  
There are a plenty of comments all over the count_words.py file, but if even though you have doubts, you can contact me.  
Enjoy!
